                <h2>2018 Nissan GT-R 35 Premium</h2>
                        <p>The Nissan GT-R (Japanese: 日産・GT-R, Nissan GT-R), is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, unveiled in 2007.[3][4][5] It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, a high performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this car was the sixth-generation model to bear the GT-R name, the model is no longer part of the Nissan Skyline model line up since that name is now reserved for Nissan's luxury-sport vehicles. The GT-R is built on the exclusively-developed Nissan PM platform, which is an enhanced evolution of the Nissan FM platform used in the separate Nissan Skyline luxury car and the Nissan Z sports car. The GT-R abbreviation stands for Gran Turismo–Racing, obtained from the Skyline GT-R.[6]

                            In 2006, then-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn determined that the GT-R would be a global icon for the Nissan brand, as unlike its predecessors which were only sold in Japan, the GT-R would be sold all around the world.[7]
                            
                            The production version of the GT-R was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, along with the PM platform, featured the exclusively developed VR38DETT engine and lot more other newer technologies. Overall body was made out of steel, aluminium and premium materials such as carbon-fiber. The GT-R achieved success as a road car as well as in motorsports.
